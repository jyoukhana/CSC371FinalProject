# MyMusicLibrary
Final project for iOS Development at DePaul University. Taken Winter 2019.

## About this project

This is a multi-screen iOS application that displays music album data with ratings and descriptions of the selected album.
The UI and segues were created by using the Storyboard editor. This application utilizes the Quartz 2D Drawing API to display
album cover art for a selected album. This application also utilizes multitouch shortcuts to easily navigate through the
application.
